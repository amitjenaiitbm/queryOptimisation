Abstract: In this study, we are addressing two aspects of the search query. First, we tried to address the problem of Hindi-English code mixed search query. Code-mixing is frequently observed in user-generated content on social media and also in web search engines, especially from multilingual users. We have considered Hindi-English mixed term queries written in common roman script. Second, we also studied the possibility of exploring the query sequence of users to automate the "Query Reformulation" process.

Web search users frequently modify their queries till they get relevant results. Previous research work has mainly concentrated on suggesting queries for users. Some research has also been carried out to identify the concept behind the queries and propose a query reformulation. The query once fired into our system, will undergo language identification to find out the language of each query term, normalize the query terms to remove ambiguities and then the normalized terms are converted to correctly spelled English words. Then the query is analyzed for inherent sequential continuity and final reformulation is done.

To test our system we have to build a Desktop Search Application. On the backend, the data on the computer system in indexed into the Apache Solr using Apache Tika and other dependency parsers. And the user can search his PC using Code-Mixed Hindi-English search query.

Keywords : Query Reformulation, Query Refinement, Query Sequence, Language Identification.
